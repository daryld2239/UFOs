# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in dpeth analysis of UFO sightings using Javascript, HTML, and CSS to by allowing users to filter for mulitple criteria simultaneously. By creating an HTML page, we added filters to filter through the dataset and display results of the filters that were chosen.

## Results
With the dataset that we were provided, the user able to input certain criteria to search UFO sightings. Using the filters, the data will render the infomration to the rows that were input. The filters are:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Summary 
The concept for this website is great, but Javascript is case sensitive so it may not work, which can be off putting to the experience of the website. Due to it being case sensitive, I thing a drop down menu for certain criteria would be more helpful. Another recommendations is to have a pop menu when there is not data to retrieve, so the user is aware and maybe they can keep an eye so they could be the first to input a sighint.
